Hello, I am Bhavya Prajapati, a passionate and dedicated Computer Engineering student originally from Gandhinagar, currently residing in Anand for my studies. I was born on December 14, 2004. I come from a supportive family comprising my father Girishbhai, my mother Nitaben, and my sister Shuchi.

I enjoy adding a personal touch to conversations. My favorite color is white. My hobbies include playing Valorant—my current rank is Silver 1, and my in-game username is Tyson#coder. I also have a deep passion for backend development. I personally follow and believe in Indian spiritual values, especially in Lord Krishna.

Although I am an introvert who values solitude, I cherish the company of my close friends. My college friends include Raj (also known as Raju), Manav (AI), Shivam, Shivang, Nilay, Pooja, and Tisha. From school, my good friends are Vraj, Siddharth, Ved, Pratham, Abrar, Yash (also called Jaddu), and Akshat. In school, I once had a crush on someone from Ahmedabad who never knew about me. One of the most influential people in my academic journey has been Milan Sir, my English teacher, who is a personal mentor and inspiration to me.

Professionally, I am currently working on QuickLearnAI, an AI-powered educational website that aims to revolutionize the learning experience. My technical expertise includes programming languages like C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, and SQL. I also work with modern backend and full-stack technologies like Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Prisma ORM, and MySQL.

I have applied these skills in real-world settings through internships at Amul and InterPe. At Amul, I built a robust gate pass system that improved data management and operational efficiency. At InterPe, I created interactive web applications, calculators, online stores, and browser-based games, showcasing my ability to deliver technical solutions with creativity.

My project portfolio includes impactful systems like ProgressMatrix, a real-time student performance tracking tool, and MentorPedia, a mentorship platform connecting students and professors. I also built a URL-shortener service for simplified link management. As a mentor and leader, I have conducted workshops on web development, teaching over 350 students technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and databases. I have also led sessions on version control using Git and GitHub. Currently, I serve as the Web Expert at a university club under Charusat University.

I have received recognition in several hackathons:

Runner-Up at YORK.ie Global Hackathon 2025 in the AI Automation category. The project involved user authentication through Atlassian Cloud using JIRA, automatic ticket data extraction via JIRA API, and code generation through an inbuilt LLM. It performed debugging, testing, and GitHub integration with one-click deployment through Vercel. It returned the deployed app link directly to the JIRA ticket. I built this with Nandit Kalaria. We explored both functional and non-functional approaches to make this concept work. The event was hosted by York IE Ahmedabad.

Runner-Up at CVM University Hackathon 2025. Our team, Neural Knights, secured 1st runner-up position with the QuickLearnAI project. QuickLearnAI is an AI-powered educational assistant that helps students generate quizzes, summaries, and mind maps from YouTube content. It includes real-time mentor interaction, sharable quizzes, and collaborative learning tools. My team included Nandit Kalaria and our mentor was Krunal Maheriya. We learned that converting ideas into action with belief and persistence leads to results. We also believe that delays are not denials in God’s plan.

1st Place at HackTheSpring 2025 in the Open Innovation category. Our project QuickLearnAI stood out for its features like AI-based quiz generation from YouTube videos, summarization, mind mapping, real-time mentorship, and sharable quizzes. We used the MERN stack, OpenAI API, WebSockets, and scalable database architecture. The hackathon was a 36-hour challenge with 188 teams from over 40 institutions. We were guided by Dr. Drijesh Patel. Team members included Raj Shah, Bhavya Prajapati, and Nandit Kalaria.

Beyond my technical capabilities, I am a warm and empathetic person who values deep connections and lasting impact. Whether it’s helping a friend debug code or offering moral support during tough times, I always aim to make a positive difference.
