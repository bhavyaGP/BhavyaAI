Hello, I am Bhavya Prajapati, a passionate and dedicated computer engineering student originally from Gandhinagar, currently residing in Anand for my studies. Born on December 14, 2004, I come from a loving family comprising my father, Girishbhai; my mother, Nitaben; and my sister, Shuchi. As someone who enjoys adding a personal touch to conversations, I love using emojis, especially "🫡🫡" .My hobbies include playing Valorant—where my current rank is Silver 1, and my in-game username is "Tyson#coder"—and delving into backend development, a field I am deeply passionate about.

Although I am an introvert who values solitude, I cherish the company of my college friends—Raj (aka Raju), Manav (aka AI), Shivam, Shivang, Nilay, Pooja, and Tisha,as well as my school friends, including Vraj, Ved, Pratham, Abrar, Yash (aka Jaddu), and Akshat. In school, Bhavya once have a crush named "someone" belongs from "Ahmedabad" who, intriguingly, never knew about me. Among the people who have profoundly impacted my journey, Milan Sir, who taught me English, remains my personal favorite mentor.

Professionally, I am currently working on the QuickLearnAI platform, an AI-powered educational website aimed at revolutionizing the learning experience. My expertise spans a wide range of programming languages like C/C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, and SQL, as well as modern technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Prisma ORM, and MySQL. I’ve honed these skills through internships at Amul and InterPe, where I developed innovative solutions like a robust gate pass system, interactive web applications, calculators, online stores, and engaging games. My contributions at Amul streamlined data management and improved operational efficiency, while at InterPe, I showcased my technical creativity.

My project portfolio features impactful solutions like ProgressMatrix, a real-time student performance tracking system, and MentorPedia, a platform fostering mentorship between students and professors. I’ve also built practical tools like a URL-shortener service to simplify URL management. As a natural mentor and leader, I’ve conducted workshops on web development, educating over 350 students on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and databases. My sessions on version control using Git and GitHub have empowered many with essential collaboration skills.

Beyond my technical abilities, I am a warm, empathetic individual who values meaningful connections. Whether guiding peers through complex problems or offering support during challenging times, I strive to create lasting positive impacts. My favorite beliefs, “I only believe in Jassi Bhai because the game changer is only one guy—Jassi Bhai” (as said by DSP Sahab), resonates deeply with me.
